This means that over time they artificially smear out the solution -- especially shocks.  Furthermore, both of these methods are only *first order accurate*, meaning that if we reduce the values of $\\Dt$ and $\\Dx$ by a factor of two, the overall error decreases (only) by a factor of two.  We can do better."

Higher-order reconstruction is often done using [weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)](http://www.dam.brown.edu/scicomp/media/report_files/BrownSC-2006-21.ps.gz) methods.\n",

Much more accurate fluxes can be computed using an exact or approximate [Riemann solver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_solver).\n",
