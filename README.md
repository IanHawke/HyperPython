HyperPython
===========

A brief and practical introduction to the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws.
This set of IPython notebooks was originally prepared for a 1-day tutorial that I
taught in Gyor, Hungary in May 2014 as part of the 
[Workshop on Design, Simulation, Optimization and Control of Green Vehicles and Transportation](http://jkk.sze.hu/en_GB/program).

To run the notebooks, you'll need:

- Python >=2.7
- IPython >=1.2.0
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Clawpack >=5.1

The last four can all be installed using pip.  To start the course, do

    cd HyperPython/lessons
    ipython notebook
    
and click on Lesson 0.

The design of the notebooks and their organization was inspired by [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/)'s excellent
[AeroPython course](https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython).
